Here is some inline code: 89 squared is `r 89**2`.

```{r, starwars-plot, fig.cap = "A ggplot of starwars humans"}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot)
starwars %>%
  filter(species=="Human") %>%
  ggplot() + aes(x = height, y = mass) + geom_point()
```

We can see in Figure \@ref(fig:starwars-plot) some humans.

```{r starwars-tbl}
starwars %>%
  filter(species == "Human") %>%
  select(name, height, mass, homeworld) %>%
  knitr::kable(caption = "A knitr kable table of starwars data")
```

We can see in Table \@ref(tab:starwars-tbl) some humans again and their details. 

```{r, my-fig, fig.cap="My non-code figure"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/Hat.png")
```

We can see in Figure \ref(@fig:my-fig) an image.
